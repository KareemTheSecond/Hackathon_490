# Hackathon_490

Hello, so if you want to test the Test.py code (a summation of the github files), please replace the FilePath to the excel file path.
If you want to test the code, I'd recommend you first try out the .ipyb file since it has aa detialed explanation of what I've done. When on the .ipyb file
please just press run once and do not mix up in the order. FOr some reason, the dataframes started to mess up MASSIVELY. I know this because I got better 
CLEANER plots of the PCA clustering on VSCode. If you want to see the clean plots of the clusters, run the VSCODE_CLEAN_PCA_TEST. It doesn't need anything; however, 
please note that the file is just put so you'd better visualize clusters on better selected features. Please note that that file isn't detailed and has a lot of 
junk while testing. The only reason I added is because the clusters looked much cleaner there (again, because something weird happened in Colab). It is also the  reason why there might be a small bug when you run Test.py.

In conclusion, the .ipynb is the way to go.
